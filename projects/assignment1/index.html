        <h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            What does this data look like as a function of time? Specifically,
            did COVID-19 have an effect on overdose rates? An increase in cases
            of depression, anxiety, and other mental health-related illnesses
            was noted under the stressful circumstances of the pandemic. I
            wonder if this trend would follow for alcohol and drug use.
          </li>
          <li>
            The drug epidemic & particularly the fentanyl crisis have been in
            the news for years. Will this data reflect that? How have the
            patterns of substance use in overdose deaths changed over time?
          </li>
          <li>
            What trends exist between various demographic characteristics and
            fatal overdoses?
          </li>
          <li>
            Is there any correlation between race & the type of substance(s)
            overdosed with? Are certain substances more common in some
            communities than others?
          </li>
          <li>
            Is there any correlation between age & the type of substance(s)
            overdosed with?

        <h2>Initial Overview</h2>
        <h3>Data Quality</h3>
        <p>
          The dataset includes many entries with zip codes that were clearly not
          in Pennsylvania, and many others still that are not in Allegheny
          county. Despite some refinement, those in the map are still not solely
          confined to the county. There were also a small number of records with
          the race of the decedent listed as “None” that needed to be filtered
          out; I wonder why these records were no classified under
          "U"/"Unknown".
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps not an issue of quality, but I noticed that the data for 2024
          seems drastically different and acknowledge that the year is not year
          complete (see Figure 3 and Figure 7). I wonder if this marked decrease
          is accurate and there truly have been such significant strides in
          reducing fatal substance overdoses, or whether this lends to that
          incompleteness.

            Top 10 Substances Most Commonly Associated with Fatal Overdoses
            <p>
              This bar chart illustrates the top 10 substances most commonly
              associated with fatal accidental overdose in Allegheny County.
              Hinting to Q2, I see that Fentanyl does indeed appear as the
              leading substance followed by Cocaine and Heroin. The data
              provides a clear comparison of the frequency at which these
              substances are found in overdose cases, serving as a crucial
              insight for public health interventions focused on these high-risk
              drugs.

            Fatal Overdose Hotspots
            <p>
              This map highlights overdose hotspots within Allegheny County, PA,
              and some surrounding areas, with darker shades indicating regions
              with higher numbers of fatal overdoses. The visualization
              effectively pinpoints areas most affected by drug overdoses,
              guiding targeted public health interventions and resource
              allocations. We can see that these hotspots are especially
              concentrated around the city of Pittsburgh and/or in less rural
              areas. Despite minor data cleanliness issues, this focused
              approach provides a clear view of critical areas needing
              attention.

            Fatal Overdoses Over Time
            <p>
              This line graph shows the trend of fatal overdoses over time,
              highlighting a significant peak around 2018 before a notable
              decline. The recent sharp decrease suggests either an effective
              intervention or a change in data reporting or collection. This
              visualization serves as a critical tool for analyzing the impacts
              of health policies and the potential emergence of new trends in
              substance use over time. To connect back to Q1, we do see an
              increase in overdoses during the years of the pandemic, and then a
              decrease as it's brought under control. However, this increase
              seems to have begun in 2018 - I'm not sure that it can be
              attributed to COVID-19.

            Age Distribution of Fatal Overdoses
            <p>
              This histogram displays the age distribution of fatal accidental
              overdoses, showing a pronounced peak in the 25 to 55 age range.
              The graph highlights that middle-aged individuals are
              disproportionately affected by overdose deaths, a crucial insight
              for public health efforts focusing on prevention and treatment
              programs targeted at this demographic. The lower incidence in
              younger and older age groups also presents an opportunity for
              early intervention and education strategies to prevent onset use
              that may lead to future overdoses.

            Gender & Race Distributions of Fatal Overdoses
            <p>
              This bar chart illustrates the distribution of fatal accidental
              overdoses by gender across different racial groups, revealing
              significant disparities in how overdose impacts these
              demographics. Notably, there is a pronounced prevalence of
              overdoses among white males, which is substantially higher than in
              other groups. This visualization underscores the necessity for
              targeted public health interventions that consider the
              intersection of race and gender in addressing the overdose crisis.

            Age & Gender Distributions of Fatal Overdoses
            <p>
              The "Gender & Age Distribution" graph displays trends in fatal
              overdoses across different age groups for males and females. It
              shows a noticeable peak in overdoses among mid-aged individuals,
              with males experiencing a higher peak around age 45-50 and females
              peaking slightly earlier. The data indicates that overdoses
              decline significantly after age 60.

            Substances in Fatal Overdoses Over Time
            <p>
              This line graph displays the trends in the number of fatal
              overdoses associated with various substances from 2007 to 2024.
              Each line represents a different substance, highlighting
              significant shifts in usage patterns over time (the Combined Od
              columns were pivoted to achieve this). Notably, the sharp rise and
              subsequent decline of Fentanyl usage and the relatively stable
              trend in substances like Methadone and Morphine provide insights
              into changing drug usage dynamics, possibly influenced by factors
              like policy changes, market availability, or public health
              interventions. This visualization is crucial for understanding how
              different substances have influenced overdose rates over the
              years. I am curious as to what the prevalence of these substances
              looks like relative to other data properties, like age or race.

            Substances in Fatal Overdoses Relative to Age
            <p>
              In response to Figure 6, this scatter plot illustrates the
              correlation between age and the types of substances involved in
              fatal overdoses. Each colored dot represents a different
              substance, showing how certain drugs are more prevalent in
              specific age groups. Notably, Fentanyl and Heroin appear
              frequently in middle-aged individuals - Heroin usage seems to peak
              in adults 25-35 years old, while Fentanyl use peaks in those 25-40
              - while substances like Alprazolam and Methadone are more evenly
              distributed across age ranges. Though it can't be determined from
              this dataset, I wonder why this is. Is it a matter of access or
              lifestyle?

            Substances in Fatal Overdoses Relative to Race
            <p>
              This grouped bar chart reveals the differences in substances
              associated with fatal overdoses among racial groups, also as a
              follow up to Figure 6. The substances, color-coded for clarity,
              show pronounced variations; for example, Fentanyl and Cocaine are
              predominant among the white population, while Cocaine outranks
              Fentalnyl for those identified as Black (with Fentanyl having such
              a strong lead in essentially every other regard within the
              dataset, I found this interesting). The impact of other substances
              like Methadone and Heroin varies notably across races. This
              visualization helps highlight the urgent need for targeted
              intervention strategies that consider these racial disparities in
              substance use and overdose risks.
